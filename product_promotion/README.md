# product promotion
## Project objectives
This project wants to predict product promotion using the APRIORI model for the Wongnai Hackathon.
1. Analyst and clean data are used to prepare and predict the model.
2. Predict data with the APRIORI model.

## Assigment Documentation
1. [AI MEETUP.pdf](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/product_promotion/AI%20MEETUP.pdf) is a file for presentation.
2. [APRIORI.pdf](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/product_promotion/APRIORI.pdf) is a theory file that is related to the APRIORI algorithm.


## Assignment File
1. [APRIORI.ipynb](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/product_promotion/APRIORI.ipynb) is a file for analyzing, cleaning, and predicting data with the APRIORI model.
2. [DaxiaoReceipt.xlsx](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/product_promotion/DaxiaoReceipt.xlsx) is a short dataset file.
3. [Full-DaxiaoReceipt.xlsx](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/product_promotion/Full-DaxiaoReceipt.xlsx) is a full dataset file.

# Result
I participated in the Wongnai Hackathon. I made it to the final 16 out of 270 teams. I did a project on product promotion design, such as buy one get one free. I use the APRIORI model.
