# customer revenue
## Project objectives
This project wants to predict customer revenue using the XGBroost model for the Techjam Hackathon(KBank Company).
1. Analyst and clean data are used to prepare and predict the model.
2. Predict data with the XGBroost model.

## Assignment File
1. [tech_jam.ipynb](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/customer_revenue/tech_jam.ipynb) is a file for analyzing, cleaning, and predicting data with the APRIORI model.
2. [cc.csv](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/customer_revenue/cc.csv),[demographics.csv](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/customer_revenue/demographics.csv),[kplus.csv](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/customer_revenue/kplus.csv),[predict.csv](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/customer_revenue/predict.csv),[train.csv](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/customer_revenue/train.csv), and [test.csv](https://github.com/micsupasun/hackathon/blob/main/customer_revenue/test.csv) is an all dataset file that we should put them together to improve accuracy and predict model.

# Result
I participated in the Techjam hackathon 2018, where I made it to the top 8 out of 1,476 teams. I predicted customer revenue. I use the XGBroost model, which has an accuracy of 91.07 percent.
